    AWS CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls made in a given AWS account. 
    The recorded information includes the identity of the API caller, the time of the API call,
    the source IP address of the API caller, the request parameters, and the response elements 
    returned by the AWS service. CloudTrail uses Amazon S3 for log file storage and delivery, 
    so log files are stored durably. In addition to capturing CloudTrail logs within a specified 
    S3 bucket for long term analysis, realtime analysis can be performed by configuring CloudTrail 
    to send logs to CloudWatch Logs. For a trail that is enabled in all regions in an account, 
    CloudTrail sends log files from all those regions to a CloudWatch Logs log group. 
    It is recommended that CloudTrail logs be sent to CloudWatch Logs.
