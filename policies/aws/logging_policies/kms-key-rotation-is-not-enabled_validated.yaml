    AWS Key Management Service (KMS) allows customers to rotate the backing 
    key which is key material stored within the KMS which is tied to 
    the key ID of the Customer Created customer master key (CMK). It 
    is the backing key that is used to perform cryptographic 
    operations such as encryption and decryption. Automated key 
    rotation currently retains all prior backing keys so that 
    decryption of encrypted data can take place transparently. It is 
    recommended that CMK key rotation be enabled.
