    VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information
    about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. 
    After you've created a flow log, you can view and retrieve its data in 
    Amazon CloudWatch Logs. It is recommended that VPC FlowLogs be enabled 
    for packet "Rejects" for VPCs. VPC Flow Logs provide visibility into 
    network traffic that traverses the VPC and can be used to detect 
    anomalous traffic or insight during security workflows.
