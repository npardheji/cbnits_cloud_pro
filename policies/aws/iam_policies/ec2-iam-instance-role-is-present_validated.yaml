    AWS access from within AWS instances can be done either encoding 
    AWS keys into AWS API calls or by assigning the instance to a 
    role which has an appropriate permissions policy for the 
    required access. "AWS Access" means accessing the APIs of AWS in 
    order to access AWS resources or manage AWS account resources.
