    The root user account is the most privileged user in AWS.
    Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of 
    protection on top of a username and password. With MFA enabled, 
    when a user signs in to an AWS website, they will be prompted 
    for their username and password as well as for an authentication 
    code from their AWS MFA device.
